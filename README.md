# skeet
CS460 Final Project, C++ networking project
(Still a work in progress)

This repository contains the solutions to a visual studio community project.
If you wish to compile and run the project on visual studio community, it will 
run as is if the solution is uploaded to visual studio.

If this is being run on a terminal or other environment, the project will need to be compiled in a (.tar)
file. One executable for the server is needed and one executable for the client/skeet game is needed.
